## Abstract

The paper presents the results of a spatio-temporal analysis of the verifiability of forecasts of the occurrence of different types of drought (meteorological, agricultural and hydrological) in July, in two regions of Poland that differ in terms of drought vulnerability. The study used real and forecast climatic data, and the time period common to both data sets (i.e., 2006-2021). The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) was used as an indicator of drought occurrence. As part of the study, maps of calculated real and predicted SPEI values for the analyzed areas were made, which were compared visually and using correlation analysis. Additionally, the study also included an analysis of the variability of SPEI over the analyzed period in two selected locations. All the resulting maps and graphs were presented in the form of a web application (interactive dashboard) allowing a simple and quick overview of all the visualizations made. The results of the study indicate that severe and extreme droughts, especially agricultural and hydrological ones, were a frequent phenomenon during the period under study. Comparison of the two analyzed regions did not confirm the assumption made that the central part of Poland (Wielkopolskie and Kujawsko-Pomorskie Voivodeships) is more vulnerable to drought than its southern part (Ma≈Çopolskie and Podkarpackie Voivodeships). Analysis of the SPEI maps showed discrepancies between actual and forecast
droughts. The forecast did not predict the occurrence of most of them, and in some years incorrectly indicated their occurrence. The decreasing trend in SPEI values was more pronounced for the forecast. The values of the correlation coefficients calculated between the actual and forecast SPEIs, as well as the climatic variables on the basis of which the index is calculated, turned out to be generally low, mostly statistically insignificant. In conclusion, the observed high frequency of severe and extreme droughts indicates the importance of monitoring this phenomenon and planning mitigation actions. The poor verifiability of the analyzed forecast draws attention to the need for further improvement of the climate models on which the forecasts are calculated.
